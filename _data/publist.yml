  description: Here, we leverage simulations in an adiabatic statistical ensemble, known as adiabatic grand-isochoric ensemble (Œº, V, L) ensemble, to reach equilibrium states with a greater efficiency than its isothermal counterpart, i.e., simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble.

  description: Dissipative systems often exhibit novel and unexpected properties. This is, for instance, the case of simple liquids, which, when subjected to shear and after reaching a steady state, can exhibit a negative entropy production over finite length scales and timescales.

- title: "Can Ordered Precursors Promote the Nucleation of Solid Solutions?"
  image: Ordered.jpg
  description: Crystallization often proceeds through successive stages that lead to a gradual increase in organization. Using molecular simulation, we determine the nucleation pathway for solid solutions of copper and gold. We identify a new nucleation mechanism (liquid‚Üíùêø‚Å¢12 precursor‚Üísolid solution) involving a chemically ordered intermediate that is more organized than the end product.

  image: Entropypath.png
  description: We combine ML with Monte Carlo simulations to study the crystal nucleation process. By taking entropy as a reaction coordinate and using the umbrella sampling technique, we are able to determine the Gibbs free energy profile for the crystal nucleation process. The approach developed here can be readily extended to molecular systems and complex fluids, and is especially promising for the study of entropy-driven processes.

- title: "Role of Liquid Polymorphism during the Crystallization of Silicon"
  image: Role.jpg
  description: When undercooled at a temperature 20% below the melting point, a silicon melt is under the form of the highly coordinated, high-density liquid (HDL) polymorph. We find that crystallization starts with the formation, within the HDL liquid, of a nanosized droplet of the least stable liquid polymorph, known as the almost tetracoordinated low-density liquid (LDL) polymorph.

  description: We use molecular simulations to study the early stages of crystallization in a supercooled liquid of Lennard-Jones particles. We observe the onset of concomitant polymorphism and demonstrate that this phenomenon results from the cross-nucleation of a metastable polymorph on the stable polymorph. We also show that cross-nucleation is selective as it only takes place between polymorphs of almost equivalent free energy.
